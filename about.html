    <p>Hi! I'm Naoko, a sophomore at the University of Michigan studying Information Analysis with a minor in Entrepreneurship. This website was inspired by my Mom, who constantly finds ways to reduce waste and has continued to influence my habits so that I know how to live a more sustainable life. I hope you enjoy my tips and tricks on how you can reduce waste and let me know if you have any questions!</p>
