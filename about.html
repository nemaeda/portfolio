            <h2>What I do</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Naoko, a sophomore at the University of Michigan studying UX Design with a minor in Entrepreneurship. I'm involved in student organizations such as Kappa Theta Pi Professional Technology Fraternity as the Design Committee Project Manager and Reach Consulting Group as Technology Consultant.</p>

            <h2>Why I care</h2>
            <p>This website was inspired by my Mom, who constantly finds ways to reduce waste and has continued to influence my habits so that I know how to live a more sustainable life. After coming to school, I began to feel really guilty about how much waste I was creating. From getting takeout, shopping, or any activity for that matter, I thought that being eco-friendly as a college student would be difficult. Over the past year, I have found many alternatives to products I had been using that generated a lot of waste, and with a little extra effort, I feel much better about the lifestyle I conduct.</p>
