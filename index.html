    <p>If everyone makes an effort to save the planet, then we have a chance at creating a less gloomy future for generations to come. The things that we value most such as seasons, nature, and the animals that create the foundation of this planet are worth fighting for, and we hope that this site allows you to start making an impact.</p>
