    <p>It's important to follow the recycling guidelines of the area that you live in. To view Ann Arbor's recycling guidelines, check them out here: https://www.recycleannarbor.org/divisions/curbside-recycling. It's important to check the recycling symbols on what you are throwing out before you assume it is safe to recycle.</p>
    <p>If you are curious about what can be composted in the on-campus bins or your own personal one, check out Ann Arbor's composting guidelines here: https://www.a2gov.org/departments/trash-recycling/Pages/Compost.aspx. Composting doesn't have to happen in a backyard, it can look just like a trash can or can even be placed in your freezer to prevent any smells.</p>
